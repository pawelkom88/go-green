## About the Project 

#### Example:

I am building this project with Next.js, TypeScript and Tailwind.

This project is currently in development. [Link](https://go-greeen.netlify.app/)

## Reflection

I like building projects that are unique. I am bored with all the tutorials where people build the same stuff over and over again. NO!

  - I have built this project in order to:
    - allow other people to actually use the app.
    - improve my skills at consuming Api's data and learning basic Typescript.
    - brush up my Tailwind knowledge
    - work on a project architecture
    - implement unit tests ( to be done )
   
  - This is one of the most challenging projects I have ever done, because:
    - There is a lot of functionality I have never or rarely implemented, like filters, displaying data on a map.
    - I focus on code readability and reusibility and the app is going to be pretty big, as for my experience.
    - I am going to use describable variable names and comments, which may seem easy, but it is not.
    - I have never done unit testing except for checking if DOM elements exist in a document.
  
  - The unexpected obstacle was to implement all features on small screens in order to keep UX on a high level. I still consider a few options.
